findmyhash
==========

Hash cracker.

### Credits

You can find the original repository there : https://code.google.com/p/findmyhash/

I thought we could remove the original README, as we have changed findmyhash's
usage, it could confuse some people.

### Usage
```./findmyhash --help```

A full documentation and functionnalities description is on its way

### News
v2.0 is coming with the removal of old services that no longer work or exist,
brand new services, a huge refactor to make the code more usable, findmyhash
as a python module, and some other cool features.

Feel free to report issues / contribute.

Stay tuned.

Latest features will be on the develop branch. However, no guarantees are given
regarding the functionnality of the code on this branch.

All releases will be done on the master branch.

Sorry about the big mess in the code, we should have started it from scratch.

### Procedure for installation:
I'm not comfortable with distributing my source code with distutils, so
forgive me for any mistake I could make there

```
python setup.py sdist
cd dist
tar -xvf libfindmyhash*
cd libfindmyhash*
```

And a classic installation with setup.py:

```python setup.py install```
